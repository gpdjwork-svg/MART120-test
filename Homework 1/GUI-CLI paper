	GUI and CLI are both interfaces one can use to interact with electronic devices. For example, GUI is used on macOS and Windows, while CLI is used in Bash and PowerShell. GUI is said to be more user-friendly, as it is more graphics-based, allowing beginners to reference distinct icons to infer their usage, and making features easier to remember. A bell points towards the notifications, a gear usually signifies the settings, etc. CLI, meanwhile, is text-based and requires previous knowledge of commands. This requires some degree of memorization. Both of these features have pros and cons. GUI may be more accessible, but it runs slower and consumes more memory on the computer, which makes it less efficient. CLI is faster for more experienced users and is similarly accessible, but only for those who are comfortable typing and have prior knowledge of the system. It takes up less space than a GUI and offers flexible customisation by combining commands and scripts. Neither is better than the other, but one might be better than the other for someone, depending on that someoneâ€™s purpose. Beginners, as said before, might feel more comfortable with a GUI, while CLI can streamline the work of someone with more experience.
